## Usage

```javascript
 Image segmentation is a commonly used technique in digital image processing and analysis to partition an image into multiple parts or regions,
 often based on the characteristics of the pixels in the image. 
 Image segmentation could involve separating foreground from background, or clustering regions of pixels based on similarities in color or shape.
 For example, a common application of image segmentation in medical imaging is to detect and label pixels in an image or voxels of a 
 3D volume that represent a tumor in a patientâ€™s brain or other organs.
